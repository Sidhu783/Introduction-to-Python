🐍 Python Programming – Super Simple Notes for Absolute Beginners

🔹 1. What is Python?

Python is a computer language.
Just like humans speak English, Hindi, or Tamil — computers understand Python (and other languages too).

We use Python to:

Build websites

Do math and data stuff

Make apps or games

Automate boring tasks


Think of Python as talking to your computer in a way it understands.

💻 Works everywhere — Windows, Mac, Linux, even your mobile!

📚 Has many tools — You don't need to build everything from scratch

👥 Big community — Millions of people already use Python, so lots of help online

🔧 3. How to Start Using Python (Step-by-Step)

🛑 Step 1: Install Python

1. Go to www.python.org


2. Click Download Python


3. During install, tick the box that says “Add Python to PATH”


4. Click Install Now



✍️ Step 2: Install an Editor

An editor is where you write your code.

📌 Recommended:

VS Code → Download

If using mobile → Python Code Pad App


✅ Step 3: Check if Python is Installed

Open Command Prompt or Terminal
Type:

python --version

If it shows something like Python 3.12.1, you’re good to go!

👋 4. Write Your First Program

1. Open your editor (like VS Code)


2. Type this code:



print("Hello, world!")

3. Save the file as hello.py


4. Run it in terminal:



python hello.py

💥 Output:

Hello, world!

Boom. You just wrote your first Python program! 🎉

❓ 5. What Does This Code Do?

print("Hello, world!")

It tells your computer:
➡️ Hey, show this text on screen.
That’s all. print() is a command.

📜 6. Python is an “Interpreted” Language

This just means:
Python runs your code line by line, from top to bottom.

If there's a mistake, it tells you exactly where. Super helpful!

You don’t need to “build” or “compile” your code like in other languages. Just write and run!
